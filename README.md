version controlling some tried and true configurations for me

If you were to clone from scratch, I think you have to run a command with submodules so that all the submodules are cloned but I haven't done it yet.

After that has happened, then you can `cp -r vim/.vim ~/` and copy the `.vimrc` over as well.
